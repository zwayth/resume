1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `resume.tex` file in your LaTeX editor.

The structure and layout of this resume were inspired by the work of [Sourabh Bajaj](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume). I've made modifications to tailor it for an AI/ML-focused ATS friendly resume.
